## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

One challenge that I had was learning the syntax for CSS. CSS isnâ€™t a language that I use often so I wasn't familiar with the concept of rules or properties. I spent a bit of time learning about that before moving forward. There was also a lot of properties to CSS that I never knew giving developers the opportunity to program a whole host of creative tasks. Another challenge that I had was finding the right colors that would work well together for the website. It's easy to pay attention to the code but how the actual product comes together for the user is key in frontend development. I think moving forward I would like to review design principles so that I can create more aesthetically pleasing projects as well as learning color theory for a more cohesive feel. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

How do developers make faster websites? I noticed a small lag between clicking the start button and the game starting. Gameplay felt a bit seperated instead of a smooth experience in typical websites. Another question I had when completing the submission is how are edits made to an already published website? Developers make changes to websites all the time however these websites aren't temporarily down to be updated. The process of how code is tested and then implemented into a prerexisiting project on a professional level would be something I'd like more insight into.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I would've liked to learn how to make the site more responsive. After looking into the process a bit more it seemed the next step is using packages like Bootstrap and Foundation to help UI. Although I didn't have the time to learn more about implementing these packages it's nice to know that there are options out there. Another aspect of the project that I would've liked to work on is a function that allowed the user to tap each button and have the beat they created be played back to them. I would've worked on creating an empty list. Each time the user taps a button it would append that specific button to the list. Afterwards that list would be the new pattern variable that would then play the user's inputted pattern.
