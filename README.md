Required Functionality
The following required functionality is complete:

Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
“Start” button toggles between “Start” and “Stop” when clicked.
Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
User loses the game after an incorrect guess
The following optional features are implemented:

Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
More than 4 functional game buttons
Playback speeds up on each turn
Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn
The following additional features are implemented:

List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

If you recorded multiple GIFs for all the implemented features, you can add them here:
**Gif does not save sound, first gif shows code for volume, second and thrid gif show loss and win respectively.

**What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)**

One challenge that I had was learning the syntax for CSS. CSS isn’t a language that I use often so I wasn’t familiar with the concept of rules or properties. I spent a bit of time learning about that before moving forward. There was also a lot of properties to CSS that I never knew giving developers the opportunity to program a whole host of creative tasks. Another challenge that I had was finding the right colors that would work well together for the website. It’s easy to pay attention to the code but how the actual product comes together for the user is key in frontend development. I think moving forward I would like to review design principles so that I can create more aesthetically pleasing projects as well as learning color theory for a more cohesive feel.

**What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)**

How do developers make faster websites? I noticed a small lag between clicking the start button and the game starting. Gameplay felt a bit seperated instead of a smooth experience in typical websites. Another question I had when completing the submission is how are edits made to an already published website? Developers make changes to websites all the time however these websites aren’t temporarily down to be updated. The process of how code is tested and then implemented into a prerexisiting project on a professional level would be something I’d like more insight into.

**If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)**

I would’ve liked to learn how to make the site more responsive. After looking into the process a bit more it seemed the next step is using packages like Bootstrap and Foundation to help UI. Although I didn’t have the time to learn more about implementing these packages it’s nice to know that there are options out there. Another aspect of the project that I would’ve liked to work on is a function that allowed the user to tap each button and have the beat they created be played back to them. I would’ve worked on creating an empty list. Each time the user taps a button it would append that specific button to the list. Afterwards that list would be the new pattern variable that would then play the user’s inputted pattern.
